# Financial-Data-Analysis
This repository contains two mini-projects completed as part of a group assignment on financial data analytics. My role focused on two core parts: logistic regression for loan approval prediction and time-series forecasting of stock prices.
## ðŸ”¹ 1. Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression

- **Dataset**:[Loan Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Objective**: Predict the probability of loan approval using a univariate logistic regression model.
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
- **Techniques**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature exploration and transformation
  - Logistic regression (univariate)
  - **K-Fold Cross Validation (k=5)** to assess model stability and generalization
  - Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

**Accuracy achieved**: 91.87%  
**Model type**: Univariate logistic regression  
**Outcome**: The model achieved high precision and recall in binary classification tasks and could be applied for preliminary loan approval automation.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Time-Series Forecasting of PNJ Stock Prices (Holt-Winters)

- **Data Source**: Crawled from [cafef.vn](https://cafef.vn/du-lieu/lich-su-giao-dich-pnj-1.chn#data)
- **Objective**: Predict PNJ's closing stock prices using the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model.
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels
- **Techniques**:
  - Time-series decomposition
  - Exponential Smoothing with additive seasonality
  - Forecasting using expanding window technique
  - Evaluation metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE

**Best Forecast Window MAE**: 15.60  
**Conclusion**: The model performed well during stable periods, but struggled with volatile phases.
